FileHandler -  Part 1
Main (setting Argument taking and passing)
Aggregating the Code
editing makefile

To Run the Code run the following commands in order:-
To compile:-
make
This makes a executable named tudent_records

To Run:-
With CGPA:-
./student_records ./input.txt cgpa

With Roll No.
./student_records ./input.txt rollno
or 
./student_records ./input.txt 
I set rollno as default so if you don't pass any argument it basically runs it with Roll Number
